## What is an account?
Currently, using one email, you can create one account in Sapien, that has a set of
agents, audiences, conversions and campaigns attached to it. 

## How to view your account details?
You can view your account details [here](https://sapien-beige.vercel.app/dashboard/user-payment).

## How much are you being billed?
You are billed based on your usage.
1. If your usage is less than 50,000 minutes a month then you are billed 0.10 USD per min.
2. If your usage is between 50,000 and 1 million minutes a month then you are billed 0.06 USD per min.
3. If your usage is higher than 1 million minutes a month then you are billed 0.04 USD per min.
Your usage is calculated after every call.
<Note>
Sometimes your credits might become slightly negative. Eg. If you had 0.01 USD balance and you made a call 
that lasted 1 minute, then your credits will become -0.09 USD.
</Note>

## How to upgrade your account?
Your account is automatically upgraded based on usage. But we also make exceptions, if you contact us at info@smallest.ai.

## How to add credits to your account?
On the account details page, click on `Add Credits`.

## How to get free credits?
By default, you should have around 2 USD worth of free credits in your account. We are working on increasing this.
