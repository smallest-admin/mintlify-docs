    First, you need to create a basic agent, that has a script, similar to what a human would follow when calling leads. 
    The agent also has other configurable parameters such as the ability to set different voices and the ability to create conversions
    criterias based on which we will qualify your leads. 
    
    Follow the instructions given in [this](/essentials/agents#how-to-create-an-agent) section to create your first Sapien agent.

  <Accordion icon="bullhorn" title="Create a campaign">
  Finally you need to create a campaign, which is basically when you setup an agent to call one or more audiences. 

  Follow the instructions given in [this](/essentials/campaigns#how-to-create-a-campaign) link to create your first campaign.

  If you are running a campaign with a large set of leads, you might need to [add credits](/essentials/account#how-to-add-credits-to-your-account).
