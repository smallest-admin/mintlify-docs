The Waves API provides advanced text-to-speech capabilities with multiple voice options and customizable sample rates. This API allows you to convert text into natural-sounding speech in various languages and accents.

## Models

Waves API supports multiple models for speech synthesis. Currently, we offer:

- **Lightning**: Our first and fastest model, optimized for low-latency applications.

To use a specific model, adjust the URL path in your API requests:

```
https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/<model>/get_speech
```

For example, to use the Lightning model:

```
https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_speech
```

We're continuously working on new models to enhance our speech synthesis capabilities. Stay tuned for announcements about additional models in the future!
