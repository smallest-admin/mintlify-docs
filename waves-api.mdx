The Waves API provides advanced text-to-speech capabilities with multiple voice options and customizable sample rates. This API allows you to convert text into natural-sounding speech in various languages and accents.

You can get your API key/Bearer token by logging into the [Waves](https://waves.smallest.ai) platform and clicking on `API key` in the left panel.

## Models

Waves API supports multiple models for speech synthesis. Currently, we offer:

- **Lightning**: Our first and fastest model, optimized for low-latency applications.

To use a specific model, adjust the URL path in your API requests:

```
https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/<model>/get_speech
```

For example, to use the Lightning model:

```
https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_speech
```

We're continuously working on new models to enhance our speech synthesis capabilities. Check [announcements](/announcements) for latest updates.

## API Specification and Code Samples

**Note:** The interactive "Try it out" feature will be available very soon.

You can find code examples on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/smallest-inc/waves-examples), demonstrating how to integrate the Smallest API with various tools and platforms.
